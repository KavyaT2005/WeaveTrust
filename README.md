WeaveTrust 🧵

WeaveTrust is a full-stack textile management system designed to bring transparency and efficiency to traditional weaving workflows. 

💡 The Inspiration (The "Why")
This project was born out of a real-world need. My father is a weaver, and I witnessed firsthand how manual record-keeping and lack of transparency could lead to communication gaps and even unfair pay for weavers.  I built WeaveTrust to digitize these manual processes and ensure that data—not just memory—drives the business.

📈 Project Evolution & Future Roadmap
This project is currently in an active development stage.  Based on direct feedback from my father (the "domain expert"), I am working on incorporating the following features:

[ ] Raw Material Tracker: To monitor yarn stock and wastage.

[ ] Detailed Profit Breakdown: Advanced financial reports for weavers.

[ ] Multi-Language Support: Adding Tamil language support for better accessibility for local weavers.

Domain Expertise: Mentioning your father as the "domain expert" shows you know how to take requirements from a user.
